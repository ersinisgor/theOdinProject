# theOdinProject

This repository includes of the projects I have completed within the scope of `The Odin Project` course. Each project is contained in its own folder within this repository, with its own README file containing more information about the project and how it was completed.

The projects cover a wide range of web development topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Git, SQL, and more.

Feel free to explore the different projects and folders within this repository to see what I have accomplished throughout The Odin Project course.
