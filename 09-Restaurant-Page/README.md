# Restaurant Page

## About

This project is a website for a restaurant created entirely using JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to learn how to create a website using ES6 modules, webpack, and dividing the web page into small parts with each page having its own functions. The website includes a home page, a menu page, and a contact page.
